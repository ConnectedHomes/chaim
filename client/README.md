## [Install](#contents)
The chaim-cli is a python 3 application. It is recommended to install into your
local, users, python packages using pip.  If this is your first local python
package then you will need to adjust your path so that the shell can find it.
```
echo 'export PATH=${HOME}/.local/bin:${PATH}' >>${HOME}/.bashrc
```

<a name='linux'></a>
### [Linux](#contents)
These instructions are for ubuntu and it's derivatives.  For other
distributions the process is similiar, though probably with different package
names.  You will need to have a version of python3 installed and a pip program
that is python3 aware.

#### Install python3
For ubuntu pre 18.04 you will need to install python3 and it's associated pip
application.  The easiest way to do this is:

```
sudo apt install python3-pip
```
which will pull in everything required.

#### Install cca
To install the chaim-cli:
```
pip3 install chaim-cli --upgrade --user --no-cache-dir
```

#### Update PATH
Once installed you will want to add `$HOME/.local/bin` to your path, if it
isn't already there:
```
echo 'export PATH=${HOME}/.local/bin:${PATH}' >>${HOME}/.bashrc
```

#### Testing
To check that all went well:
```
cca version
```
Should give you the current version number of the chaim-cli.

<a name='macosx'></a>
### [Mac OSX](#contents)
#### Install python3
Recently the folks that manage homebrew changed the default python, which
conflicts with the python supplied by the OS.  See this home brew
[discussion](https://discourse.brew.sh/t/brew-install-python3-fails/1756/8).
So, to get python3 (and keep python2) you now need to do:
```
brew upgrade python
brew install python2
```
which will install python3 and the latest released version of python2.

#### Install cca
To install the chaim-cli:
```
pip install chaim-cli --upgrade --user --no-cache-dir
```

#### Update PATH
Once installed you will want to add `$HOME/Library/.Python/3.7/bin` to your path, if it
isn't already there (adjust the version to suit your circumstances):
```
echo 'export PATH=${HOME}/Library/Python/3.7/bin:${PATH}' >>${HOME}/.bashrc
```

#### Testing
To check that all went well:
```
cca version
```
Should give you the current version number of the chaim-cli.

<a name='ccaaccount'></a>
#### [account](#contents)
```
$ cca account --help
Usage: cca account [OPTIONS] ACCOUNT

  Retrieve credentials for ACCOUNT account

Options:
  -r, --role TEXT         optional the role to assume for this account
                          default: rro
  -d, --duration INTEGER  optional duration must be between 1-12 or 900-43,200
                          default 1
  -a, --alias TEXT        optional alias for the account name, to be used as
                          the profile name
  -D, --default           optional set this account to be the default account
                          profile to use
  -R, --region TEXT       optional region
  -T, --terrible          Add support for Terraform/Ansible to the credentials
                          file
  --help                  Show this message and exit.
```
The `-T|--terrible` switch copies the `aws_session_token` key to the `aws_security_token` key.
This ensures that products such as Ansible and Terraform which still use the `aws_security_token`
will continue to work.

<a name='ccadelete'></a>
#### [delete](#contents)
Delete credentials for the named account(s).

<a name='ccagui'></a>
#### [gui](#contents)
This command generates a console session url and opens a browser window to it.
The credentials will be automatically renewed first.

<a name='ccagso'></a>
#### [gso](#contents)
This command generates a console session url, attempts to logout of any current
session, and opens a browser window to the url.
The credentials will be automatically renewed first.

Note: There doesn't seem to be any way to access the browser tab with AWS
running in it, so this process first opens a new tab to issue the logout
command, then a 2nd new tab to log you into the new account.  This will leave
you with 2 extra tabs, sorry.

<a name='ccainit'></a>
#### [init](#contents)
Initialises the application with a user token obtained from Slack.  Either
supply the base64 encoded info from Slack as a parameter, or use the command
bare to be asked the pertinent questions.
```

cca has been re-initialised.
Your token will expire in 29 days, 21 hours, 19 minutes and 52 seconds.
