Retire generic slack token and use a 'proper' auth token this will now show the app name as 'chaim' rather than 'slack API
Tester'
Slack API tokens are now stored under the environment path as well as under the workspaceid
'identify' command now returns to slack quickly without any other checks
Ensure data is returned to the 'slack' user name not the 'chaim' user name
Chaim now has limited OAuth Scope in Slack
Client uses workspaceid if it is present
Add questions for slackid and workspaceid when initialising the client
Slack api token is now only obtained just before it is required - this fixes the client being unable to decode the output from
chaim.
Further documentation updates.
